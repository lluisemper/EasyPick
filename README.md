### What is this?

Recipe app with image recognition

A simple yet charming recipe book built in React, using Vision API and edamen Food API. I mostly built this with the purpose of practicing everything that I learnt during the first part of the bootcamp, eg. redux, auth, full stack Development.

### How to start!

npm i in cd backend && and npm i in cd my-firstsoloproject which you will need to set up a .env file like in the example( the keys they are from facebook developers auth). Also you will need to get the json file from the vision API on the google console. Run both servers and database and have fun!

### Observations

ü§ì Room for improvement

* Improvements in the UI, like responsivenes.
* Deploying the app the be able to show it staright away, unfortunatelly google would try to make me pay
* Testing üßê my first fullstack app where I only had 6 days to complete
* https://www.loom.com/share/f392a7ca78894bfaa83116cdfcb29699 embarrassing video of myself trying the app :)

ü¶Ñ Looking to the future

* Design principles and better understanding of code architecture best practices
* More precise image recognition
