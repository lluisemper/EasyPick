What is it?

Recipe app with image recognition

A simple yet charming recipe book built in React, using Vision API and edamen Food API. I mostly built this with the purpose of practicing everything that I learnt during the first part of the bootcamp, eg. redux, auth, full stack Development.

How to start!

npm i in cd backend && and npm i in cd my-firstsoloproject which you will need to set up a .env file like in the example. Also you will need to get the json file from the vision API.
